# J-Clock

## Documentation
- This program was created by Jacky He on 01/03/2022.
> *“Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.”*

## Description 
- This project is an implementation of a clock that shows time both through the sun & moon (like traditional 'times') or on the implemented clock. 
- For the sun, moon, and other small stars, I used **Three.js** to create both the models and, hopefully, its movements. 
- This project is still in progress as you will later see in the ‘Snapshots’ section. However, I do plan on implementing a functional clock that tells accurate time as well as having the sun & moon move accordingly. 

## Tools Used
- ViteJS
- Three.js
> This repository does not include these modules.

## Use of Project
- This project is straightforward with its intended purpose, to tell time. You can just look at the clock to tell you the time, however, when do you ever get the opportunity to practice telling time when no presence of time is available? This will hopefully present a challenge to you.
